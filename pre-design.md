# Pre-Design

## Turns

Players pay for cards by discarding cards from their hands (or decks?).

Play one monster per turn only.

No other limit for cards played on a turn.

## Card Types

- Monsters
  - Attack, health, effect
  - Play one per turn
- Action spell
  - Play during your main phase 1 or 2
  - Play as many as you like
- Reaction spell
  - Can be played any time in response to another action
  - Resolved as a stack like Magic

## Combat

- Player cannot be targeted as long as they control monsters
- Attacker takes initiative by choosing attack targets
- One target can be selected per attacker
- After attacks are resolved opponent has an opportunity to counterattack
- After counterattack all damage is healed

## Card Locations

- Hand
  - Draw 4 cards at start of game and 1 at the start of each turn
  - Discard down to 7 cards at the end of your turn
- Deck
  - Starts at exactly 30 cards
  - Damage dealt to players causes them to discard cards from the top of their deck
  - Drawing a card from an empty deck causes a player to lose the game
- Discard
  - Resolved spells, dead monsters, and cards discarded from the deck go in the discard pile
  - Always face up, and can be viewed at any time - but order is preserved
- Removed from play
  - Can be thought of as physically destroyed - cannot be interacted with at all
