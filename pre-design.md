# Pre-Design

## Turns

Players pay for cards by discarding cards from their hands (or decks?).

Play one monster per turn only.

No other limit for cards played on a turn.

## Card Costs

- Hand discard
  - Appropriate for aggressive decks that cycle through cards quickly.
  - Might be unique to the fire element.
  - Card self-selected so cost can be minor.
- Deck discard
  - Primary cost for most cards.
  - Equivalent to damage.
  - Card chosen randomly so can be disruptive against unevenly distributed decks.
  - Appropriate for midrange decks.
- Discard pile limit
  - Can be played so long as discard pile has enough cards.
  - Could be unique to spirit.
  - Locks powerful cards out of being played until later in the game.
  - Allows players that are behind to catch up.
  - More appropriate for control decks that need powerful late-game cards.

## Combat

- One target can be selected per attacker
- After attacks are resolved opponent has an opportunity to counterattack
- After counterattack all damage is healed

## Card Locations

- Hand
  - Draw 4 cards at start of game and 1 at the start of each turn
  - Discard down to 7 cards at the end of your turn
- Deck
  - Starts at exactly 30 cards
  - Damage dealt to players causes them to discard cards from the top of their deck
  - Drawing a card from an empty deck causes a player to lose the game
- Discard
  - Resolved spells, dead monsters, and cards discarded from the deck go in the discard pile
  - Always face up, and can be viewed at any time - but order is preserved
- Removed from play
  - Can be thought of as physically destroyed - cannot be interacted with at all
